<!-- This is very good.  I've been wondering if we should have a "References" section at the bottom pointing students to other resources eg JS Novice to Ninja and others,
and  to our favourite web resources as well ?? -->

Here are a list of up to date resources (at time of last update)

* [Mozilla Developer Network: JavaScript](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [*JavaScript: Novice to Ninja*, Darren Jones (Sitepoint, 2015)](http://www.sitepoint.com/store/leaern-javascript-novice-to-ninja/)
