# Operators

What can we do with values? Make new values from old ones. These are called *operations*.

We use *operators* to signify that we wish to perform these operations.

Operations are performed on one, two or three other values, called *operands*

## Numbers and Arithmetic

* `+` addition
* `-` subtraction
* `*` multiplication
* `/` division
* `%` remainder

Addition is performed with the `+` operator.

## Strings and Concatenation

* `+` concatenation (linking things together)

## Boolean values and Logical Operations

* `&&` logical AND
* `||` logical OR
* `!`  logical NOT (unary)
* `.. ? .. : ..` Conditional operator (ternary)

## Formatting

Because good code is easily read, always put a space on both sides of an operator. As you'll see this might be a bit weird for unar

**Good**:
* `1 + 1`
* `"His name is " + " Robert Paulson."`
*
